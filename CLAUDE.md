# VisBench

Unified library for probing vision backbones (DINOv2, CLIP, custom) across
high-level, mid-level, and eventually low-level computer vision tasks, through
a `get_backbone()` / `get_probe()` API. Sibling project to vismatch (image
matching - https://github.com/gmberton/vismatch), same ergonomic philosophy, applied to representation probing
instead of matching.

**Distribution**: this ships as a pip-installable Python package on
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/) (`pip install visbench`), not just a research repo.
Packaging conventions (pyproject.toml, semantic versioning, a lockfile) apply
from v0.1 onward, not bolted on later.

**Prior art to credit explicitly, not re-derive**:
- [probe3d](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08476) (El Banani et al., CVPR 2024) —
  reuse its evaluation protocols for depth, surface normal, and correspondence.
- Chen, Marks & Cheng, ["Probing the Mid-level Vision Capabilities of
  Self-Supervised Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17474) — the task
  categorization below follows this paper directly.

## Critical: build order — read this before writing any code

Do not implement all tasks, backbones, and versions in one pass. This is a
multi-month roadmap; **each session completes one step and stops for review**,
not racing ahead. If asked to "build VisBench" or "continue", re-confirm which
step is next rather than attempting the whole roadmap in one session.

| Step | What | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Scaffold every folder and module, docstrings + stubs, no logic | done |
| 2 | `BaseBackbone` + feature cache + DINOv2, with tests | done |
| 3 | `BaseTask` + one task (retrieval) end to end on a local folder | done |
| 4 | All three v0.1 tasks, both v0.1 backbones, `uv.lock`, `run()` | done |
| 5a | ResNet/timm backbone — first non-ViT, validates the CNN half | done |
| 5b | Custom `nn.Module` backbones, and pluggable heads (linear + DPT) | done |
| 5c | Multi-layer extraction through every backbone and the cache | done |
| 5d | Depth estimation — first dense task, full probe3d protocol | done |
| 5e | Streaming features from disk, for splits larger than memory | done |
| 5f | Surface normals + the shared `DenseTrainingTask` | done |
| 5g | Generic (binary) segmentation | done |
| **5h** | **High-level semantic (multi-class) segmentation** | **next** |
| 5i | Mid-level image similarity | todo |
| 5j | The CLI — last, once the dense-task Python API has settled | todo |
| 6 | v0.3 scope. Do not start before v0.2 is complete and reviewed | todo |

---

## Current state

**v0.1 complete. v0.2 roughly three-quarters done.** Everything below exists, is
tested, and is on `main`.

Registered names — `visbench.list_backbones()`, `list_probes()`,
`visbench.heads.list_heads()`:

```text
backbones  dinov2_vits14, dinov2_vitb14, clip_vitb16, clip_vitb32,
           resnet18, resnet50            (+ CustomBackbone, unregistered)
probes     classification, retrieval, correspondence, depth, surface_normal,
           generic_segmentation
heads      linear, dpt
```

Package version is still `0.1.0` — nothing has been released to PyPI yet.
Result schema is at **v4** (`layers` field added in 5c) and is **additive
only**: never remove or repurpose a field, or old records stop being readable.

### Layout worth knowing before editing

```text
visbench/
  backbones/     base.py (resolve_layers, _assemble), dinov2, clip,
                 timm_backbone, custom, pooling.py (feature modes)
  cache/         feature_cache.py (_Plan/_walk, extract_dataset, materialise)
                 streaming.py (CachedFeatures — a torch Dataset over the cache)
  data/          image_folder, pair_dataset (correspondence), dense.py
                 (DenseFolderDataset, load_depth_map, load_normal_map,
                  load_mask)
  heads/         base.py (register_head/build_head), linear.py, dpt.py
  metrics/       classification, retrieval, correspondence, dense.py
  tasks/         base.py (BaseTask)
                 dense_base.py (DenseTrainingTask — shared by every dense probe)
                 high_level/  classification, retrieval  (+ stubs)
                 mid_level/   correspondence, depth, surface_normal,
                              generic_segmentation  (+ stubs)
  results/       schema.py (ResultRecord, SCHEMA_VERSION), writer.py
  runner.py      visbench.run() — the one call the CLI will wrap
examples/        classify, retrieve, correspond, depth, normals, segment
```

### `DenseTrainingTask` — subclass this for 5h

`visbench/tasks/dense_base.py` holds everything a trained dense probe needs:
feature sources (in-memory dict *or* streaming `CachedFeatures`, normalised to
one indexable source), batching, head construction, the AdamW + warmup/cosine
schedule, the training loop, batch-wise `predict`/`evaluate`, and per-image
metric averaging. A subclass supplies only:

- `out_channels` — how many channels the head emits
- `_activate(raw)` — raw head output → prediction (applied in loss, metrics
  *and* `predict`, so those three can never disagree)
- `_loss(pred, target)` — both `(B, C, H, W)`
- `_batch_metrics(pred, target)` — must return **per-image averages**, which is
  what lets `evaluate` weight each batch by size and recover the split number
- `target_channels`, `display_name`, `target_noun`, `level`, `name`
- optionally `_task_params()` (extra `task_params` for the record) and
  `_on_epoch_start()` (per-epoch diagnostic hook)

`DepthTask` is 224 lines, `SurfaceNormalTask` 299 and
`GenericSegmentationTask` 173 because of this — read them before writing a
fourth. Between them they show a scalar target and a vector one; a
bin-expectation activation, a normalising one and a sigmoid; a protocol borrowed
wholesale from probe3d and one that only borrows its schedule. The base was
lifted out of a *working* `DepthTask` when the second task arrived, not
designed up front; extend it the same way, from a case that already runs.

### Decisions already paid for — do not re-litigate or re-derive

- **Fetch probe3d's real source before implementing any of its protocols.**
  Reconstructing depth from memory would have produced scalar regression
  instead of the 256-bin expectation, which is a materially different probe.
- **Not all of probe3d is MIT.** `evals/utils/metrics.py`, `losses.py` and
  `probes.py` are safe to follow. `evals/utils/correspondence.py` and
  `evals/models/croco_models/` are **CC BY-NC** and must never be copied — see
  `NOTICE`, which is the consolidated record.
- **Dense geometry**: image and target must survive the *same* resize and crop,
  applied by the dataset, and targets resample **nearest-neighbour**. Bilinear
  averages across depth discontinuities and turns a hole's zeros into a halo of
  plausible wrong values the valid mask no longer excludes. The correspondence
  task already paid for a misalignment bug once (recall@1px = 0.003).
- **Validity convention**: a pixel is invalid where the target is 0 (depth) or
  zero-length (normals). Cap out-of-range values by *marking them invalid*, not
  clamping — clamping trains and scores against a wall of fabricated values.
  **Label maps are the exception and shift by one**: for segmentation 0 is a
  real class (background) and an unlabelled pixel is *negative*. Reusing the
  depth convention there would discard every background pixel and train the
  probe to answer foreground everywhere. Semantic segmentation (5h) inherits
  this — its ignore label must not collide with class 0 either.
- **Not every dense task gets to borrow probe3d.** It has no binary
  segmentation task, so `GenericSegmentationTask` keeps only its *optimiser*
  schedule and records `protocol: "visbench_binary_seg"`. Do not let a record
  claim `"probe3d"` for a loss and metric that paper never defined; the whole
  value of the field is that it says what a number is comparable to.
- **The ten-epoch schedule assumes NYUv2-sized data.** Measured on 80 training
  images: 0.16 IoU at the defaults, 0.87 at `epochs=40, lr=5e-3`, identical
  features. That is underfitting, not a weak representation, and `train_loss`
  is what separates the two. Do not tune the defaults away from probe3d's —
  say so in the example instead, which `examples/segment.py` does.
- **Per image, then averaged.** Never pool every pixel of the split; that lets
  uneven hole coverage silently reweight the dataset.
- **Dense features stream.** ~250x the size of pooled ones (24k NYUv2 images at
  DINOv2-B is ~19 GB). `run()` streams automatically for `uses_dense` tasks.
  Measured: 10.8 GB peak RSS in memory vs 1.7 GB streaming for 0.63 GB of
  features. `CachedFeatures` is random-access, not a generator — training
  reshuffles every epoch and a generator can only shuffle *within* a batch.
- **Targets travel by index, never by iteration order**, or they drift from
  their features the moment a loader shuffles. Silent failure: it still trains.
- **probe3d's uncertainty-aware angular loss can switch itself off** near chance
  accuracy. `SurfaceNormalTask.fit` documents the measured dynamics, detects it
  and warns. The loss is deliberately left as probe3d wrote it — silently
  substituting the plain one would make VisBench's numbers incomparable with
  the published ones, which is the only reason to borrow a protocol at all.
- **mypy's `python_version` tracks the newest syntax any *dependency stub* uses,
  not the package's floor.** It is pinned to 3.12 in `pyproject.toml` because
  numpy 2.x uses PEP 695 `type` statements. Do not "fix" it down to 3.9.
- **Verify with the exact commands CI runs** (below). A local env with extra
  packages installed will pass checks that CI fails.

`CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` is the full record of what each step
added and why; `README.md` has the user-facing view and the measured Imagenette
numbers. Both are kept current per step — update them in the same commit as the
code, not afterwards.

**Update this file at the end of every step, in that same commit.** The build
table, the registered names, the layout block, the v0.2 checklist and the
"decisions already paid for" list are how the next session knows where the work
stands and what it must not re-derive; a step that ships code without updating
them has left the next session to rediscover its findings the expensive way.

## Architecture

### `BaseBackbone`

- One method, `.extract_features(image, pooling="default", layers=None,
  feature_mode="dense_only")`, returning a `FeatureDict`:
  `{"dense", "pooled", "grid_hw", "cls", "dense_layers", "layer_indices"}`.
- Returns **both** the dense spatial features and a pooled single vector from
  the same call — tasks pick whichever they need, backbones never expose
  separate methods per use case.
- Subclasses implement `_forward_features(image, layers) -> list[LayerOutput]`,
  one `(patch_tokens, cls_or_None, grid_hw)` per requested depth, from **one**
  forward pass. `resolve_layers()` on the base turns `None`/negatives into
  absolute indices and enforces strictly increasing order — order is meaningful,
  since DPT reads the first as coarsest.
- `dense`, `pooled` and `cls` always describe the **last** requested layer, so a
  multi-layer call is a strict superset of a single-layer one and a task reading
  only `dense` is unaffected. Multi-layer maps live under `dense_layers`, a
  separate key rather than `dense` sometimes being a list.
- Same method signature for every backbone type (ViT or CNN) even though the
  internals differ completely — see CNN vs ViT handling below.

### `BaseTask` (a.k.a. probe)

- `.fit(features, labels)` — no-op for zero-shot tasks (retrieval,
  correspondence).
- `.evaluate(features, labels) -> dict` — always returns a flat metrics dict,
  never prints results directly (see structured logging below).
- `.predict(features)`.
- **Pooling strategy is chosen here, not on the backbone.** A task passes
  `pooling="cls"` or `pooling="mean"` (etc.) into `extract_features()`; the
  backbone just executes whatever is asked. This keeps backbones dumb and
  interchangeable, and keeps the "what representation does this task need"
  decision in one place. Same for `feature_mode` and `layers`.
- A task **declares** `uses_dense`, rather than it being inferred from the
  task's level: it tells the cache which half of the extraction to keep and
  whether to stream, and dense features are ~250x larger, so guessing would be
  an expensive guess.
- `describe()` returns the metadata for the result record and always includes
  `task_params`, empty by default — a caller building a record should never
  have to ask whether a particular task has hyperparameters.
- `run()` records `pooling` **resolved** (`"default"` means CLS on a ViT and
  mean on a CNN, so the literal word does not say what produced the number).

### Feature cache

Mandatory in v0.1, not an optional speed-up added later. Disk-backed
key-value store, one file per (image, layer), keyed by
`backbone_key | layer | pooling | feature_mode | image_hash`. Every task reads
from the cache; the backbone forward pass runs at most once per image per
backbone. Two front doors:

- `extract_dataset(...)` stacks everything and returns one `FeatureDict`.
  Right for pooled features; impossible for dense ones.
- `materialise(...)` runs the same extraction, keeps nothing in memory, and
  returns a `CachedFeatures` — an ordinary `torch.utils.data.Dataset` over the
  files already on disk, so a `DataLoader` supplies batching, shuffling and
  workers. Pass `targets=dataset.target` to pair supervision by index.

---

## Feature extraction design — the most important decision in this codebase

Handle this consistently; don't improvise per-backbone.

### Default pooling rules
- ViT backbones with a CLS token → default single-vector representation is
  the **CLS token**.
- CNNs, and any backbone without a CLS token → default is **mean-pooling**
  over the dense feature map / patch tokens.
- Either default can be overridden per task call via the `pooling` argument.

### Dense-task feature modes (all three implemented and reachable through
`extract_features(feature_mode=...)`; mode 1 is the default)

1. **`dense_only`** (default) — just the spatial grid of patch/conv
   features, no CLS involved.
2. **`dense_cls_broadcast`** — the CLS token is broadcast spatially and
   concatenated onto every patch location, increasing channel dim uniformly
   across the grid.
3. **`dense_plus_cls`** — the dense grid and a single global CLS vector are
   kept **separate** and both handed to the task head, which decides how to
   fuse them (e.g. only at a bottleneck, or as a global conditioning vector),
   rather than broadcasting CLS into every spatial location.

Modes 2 and 3 are opt-in — a task must explicitly request them. The cache keys
on the mode, and `dense_plus_cls` returns the global vector under a separate
`cls` key. `DPTHead` is the consumer these were built for.

### CNN vs ViT handling
- **CNNs**: "dense features" = the last conv feature map before global
  pooling (e.g. `layer4` output of a ResNet).
- **ViTs**: "dense features" = the patch token grid, reshaped from
  `(num_patches, dim)` to `(H, W, dim)` using the model's known patch size and
  input resolution.
- Both are exposed through the **identical** `.extract_features()` signature
  and return shape, even though the internal extraction logic is completely
  different per architecture family.

### Multi-layer extraction
Declared in the interface from v0.1, **wired up in v0.2 (step 5c)** for every
backbone: `layers=[2, 5, 8, 11]` returns one map per depth from a single
forward pass. `visbench.run()` carries a task's declared `layers` into
extraction, and the result record stores them **resolved** against that
backbone's depth — `[-4, -1]` names different blocks on a 12- and a 24-block
ViT, so an unresolved record does not say what produced the number.

## Task categorization

Tasks are organized into three levels, following Chen, Marks & Cheng
(arXiv:2411.17474):

```text
tasks/
  high_level/   classification, semantic (multi-class) segmentation, detection
  mid_level/    generic (binary) object segmentation, depth estimation,
                surface normal estimation, geometric correspondence,
                mid-level image similarity
  low_level/    placeholder only until v0.3+ — edge detection, optical flow,
                texture/reflectance, image quality
```

- **High-level** = semantic/category understanding.
- **Mid-level** = geometry and generic structure prior to semantic labeling —
  this is the paper's core contribution area, and it's where VisBench should
  be strongest relative to existing tools.
- **Mid-level image similarity is a distinct task class from high-level
  (semantic) retrieval** — mid-level similarity judges perceptual/geometric
  resemblance between candidates and a reference (scene layout, geometry),
  not category membership. Do not merge these two into one task even though
  both are "similarity"-flavored.
- **Low-level** is a folder with a README describing future scope only —
  nothing implemented there before v0.3, and possibly not even then without
  contributor bandwidth.

---

## v0.1 — prove the abstraction — **COMPLETE**

Kept for the record; the boundaries below applied to v0.1 only and no longer
constrain new work. Dense-prediction training loops are v0.2 scope and exist.

**Hard boundary (v0.1 only): no fine-tuning, no dense-prediction training
loops. Every v0.1 task either needs no training (zero-shot) or trains a linear
layer on cached features.**

- **Backbones**: DINOv2 (ViT-S/B) and CLIP (OpenCLIP ViT-B) only. No
  ResNet/timm, no custom-backbone support yet — that's v0.2.
- **Tasks**:
  - High-level image classification — linear probe on cached pooled features.
  - High-level image retrieval — zero-shot, cosine similarity over cached
    pooled features (CLS default for ViT backbones).
  - Mid-level geometric correspondence — zero-shot, dense feature matching
    (conceptually reusing matching logic familiar from vismatch (https://github.com/gmberton/vismatch), applied to
    raw backbone features instead of dedicated matcher networks).
- **Required infrastructure before any task code**: reviewed folder skeleton
  → `BaseBackbone` with dual pooled+dense output → feature cache → `BaseTask`
  abstraction → structured JSON result logging (see below), from the very
  first task, not retrofitted later.
- **Explicitly deferred**: CLI, custom backbones, ResNet/timm, multi-layer
  extraction, any dense-prediction task, fine-tuning.

---

## v0.2 — dense mid-level tasks + broader backbone support — **IN PROGRESS**

- [x] ResNet/timm backbones and user-supplied custom-backbone support
      (arbitrary `nn.Module` + preprocessing function).
- [x] **Pluggable task heads**, never hardcoded to one architecture: `linear`
      and `dpt` ship, `register_head` is the extension point. A head declares
      which feature modes it consumes and rejects a mismatch at construction.
      `DPTHead` refuses a single feature map rather than duplicating it.
- [x] Multi-layer feature extraction, now that the single-layer path is proven.
- [x] Depth estimation, surface normal estimation — probe3d's protocols used
      directly rather than re-deriving metrics.
- [x] **Generic (binary) object segmentation** — `GenericSegmentationTask`,
      sigmoid + masked BCE + `binary_iou` (foreground IoU, Dice, pixel
      accuracy). `load_mask` reads 0/1 or 0/255 as "non-zero is foreground" and
      never rescales; `ignore_index=` maps a dataset's ignore value to -1.
      `DenseFolderDataset` needed no change, but **do not pass `max_target` for
      a mask** — it would erase the foreground class.
- [ ] **High-level semantic (multi-class) segmentation — next.** Alongside the
      mid-level binary one so the two can be compared directly. Same base
      class; the new pieces are mIoU and a class-index target that must **not**
      be resampled as a float. Read `GenericSegmentationTask` first: it already
      settled the ignore convention (negative, not 0) and the "this is not
      probe3d's protocol" record field, and both carry over unchanged. Its
      `out_channels` becomes the class count, `_activate` a softmax or an
      argmax-free logit passthrough, and the loss cross-entropy over a `long`
      target — note the base coerces targets to **float**, which is the one
      place a class-index target does not fit the existing path.
- [ ] Mid-level image similarity as its own task, separate from high-level
      retrieval — see the task-categorization note; do not merge them.
- [ ] The CLI, last, once the dense-task Python API has settled. It should be a
      thin wrapper over `visbench.run()`, which was written to be exactly that.
      Note `run()` does not yet cover correspondence (it takes pairs plus
      geometry, not images plus labels) — decide how pairwise extraction is
      expressed when the CLI lands.

---

## v0.3 — fine-tuning + detection groundwork

- Fine-tuning mode: allow unfreezing the last N backbone blocks per task,
  opt-in, off by default.
- Begin high-level detection support (lightweight head). Expect this to take
  longer than any other single addition — it's the hardest task to do cheaply
  on limited compute.
- Low-level tasks get their first real entries if there's contributor
  bandwidth (edge detection, optical flow); otherwise the folder stays a
  placeholder.
- HF Hub integration for sharing pretrained probe heads and a public
  leaderboard, once there's enough task/backbone coverage for a leaderboard
  to be meaningful.

---

## Engineering conventions

- PyTorch, Python 3.9+. Optional extras: `clip` (open_clip), `timm`, `dev`.
  A backbone whose extra is missing is skipped in the registry, not fatal.
- Pin exact dependency versions via `uv.lock` — this is a reproducible
  benchmark library, not a moving-target research repo.
- Write tests alongside every new module; don't defer testing to "later."
- Every task run logs a structured JSON record — backbone, task, dataset,
  pooling mode, feature mode, layers, metrics, timestamp — under one
  **additive-only** schema, so leaderboard tooling never needs a retrofit.
  Bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` when adding a field; never remove or repurpose one.
- Package for PyPI from v0.1: `pyproject.toml`, semantic versioning,
  `pip install visbench` as the eventual target install path.
- Cite prior art in code comments and docs wherever an evaluation protocol is
  borrowed, not just in the README. `NOTICE` is the consolidated list.

### Verifying — use these exact commands

The project venv is `.venv/` — Python 3.9.21, the supported floor, with
`visbench` installed editable and all extras present. **Use it.** Another
interpreter on the machine will not have `visbench` importable (examples fail
with `ModuleNotFoundError`) and may have different dependency versions.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate       # or call .venv/bin/<tool> directly

pytest                                              # 621 fast tests
pytest -m slow                                      # 73, real DINOv2/CLIP weights
ruff check visbench/ tests/ conftest.py
ruff format --check visbench/ tests/ conftest.py
mypy visbench/ --ignore-missing-imports             # reads [tool.mypy], py 3.12
```

CI runs these five and nothing else. A local environment with extra packages
installed will pass checks that CI fails, so do not substitute your own
invocations — particularly for mypy, which reads `python_version` from
`pyproject.toml` and checks nothing useful if you override it.

Both suites and all three lint steps must be clean before a commit. Prove a
new task end to end on a real backbone via its `examples/` script, not only
against the fake backbones in `tests/conftest.py`; the toy backbones cannot
show a training-dynamics problem, and one has already been found that way.
